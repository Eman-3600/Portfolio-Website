                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Evan Stagl. I am an aspiring game developer and programmer looking to join a team. I've worked on many projects, both personal and for school, and now I have my sights set on professional development.</p>
                <p>I began learning Java while I was still in elementary school where I used it to develop small mods for Minecraft. Ever since, I've known that I wanted to develop games for a living. Nearly every step I've taken since has brought me closer to achieving that goal.</p>

                <p>I have developed a plethora of programming projects, including apps, small games, and game modifications. On the left is a modification I developed for Minecraft, which I call Demons and Dreams.</p>
