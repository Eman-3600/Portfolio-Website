                <h2>My Music</h2>
                <p>I decided to learn how to compose music despite never having a formal musical education because I wanted to be able to set the tone of my games and mods. The following music was written for my Minecraft mod, Demons and Dreams.</p>

                <p>Given that Mental Mire used reversed instruments quite heavily, I wanted to hear what the whole track sounded like in reverse, and it turned out fairly well.</p>

                <p>I intended this track to evoke a sense of unease, echoing the insanity that it is meant to encompass. Though the day is usually safe, once the shadows begin to darken, the player hears this and realizes that danger is closer than it appears.</p>

                <p>When I started working on this track, I intended it to play in a mysterious region with a dark undertone, but it eventually expanded into its own track that told its own story. It is now a music disc in-game.</p>

                <p>The player approaches the dragon that stole fate, and this track accompanies them. This track is really where I settled on the motif for the mod's antagonist, which constitutes the entire repeating melody of the track.</p>

                <p>A truly alien forest surrounds you, filled with marble bark and golden leaves. The grass too seems golden, as do the angelic inhabitants. Despite the bright of the forest, the sky is black as the night. This place is no willing home, and the dissonance in the music says as such.</p>

                <p>An invincible guardian chases you through the city that bore a great disease. The guardian is blind, but its shrieks are enough to locate you. This track is intended to chase the player as much as the monster they run from.</p>
