                <h2>Graviton</h2>
                <p>Graviton is a top-down puzzle game where the player has to travel across moving tiles to reach their destination. The player can move all tiles at once in one of four directions, and their goal is to reach the destination in as few moves as possible. It was submitted to the 2020-2021 Computer Game and Simulation Programming contest for FBLA and can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eD7BqPpUD2eLQSr5uTOuC9wrvdtLh_vI/view">here</a>.</p>
                <p>I developed the game with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brayden-anderson-869269266/">Brayden Anderson</a>. I designed the game as a whole and most of the levels, and I also did the entirety of the programming. The player sprite was made by Brayden. On the left is one of the levels I designed.</p>

                <h2>Demons and Dreams</h2>
                <p>Demons and Dreams is a large content mod for Minecraft that is still in development. It currently adds three new dimensions, two of which are accessible, a new biome in the End, many new weapons, armors, and magic items, new magic and sanity meters, and much more. The repository for it can be found <a href="https://github.com/Archmage-Coalition/dndreams">here</a>.</p>
                <p>I am developing the mod with a few other people, most of whom are developing the visual assets. Most of the programming was done by me. For the other contributors, see the <a href="https://github.com/Archmage-Coalition/dndreams/graphs/contributors">repository</a>.</p>

                <h2>Balatro on the Clocktower</h2>
                <p>Balatro on the Clocktower is a mod for the recent hit game, Balatro. It is currently still in development and adds new boss blinds and jokers to the game, each attempting to mirror a different character from the social deduction game, <a href="https://bloodontheclocktower.com/"><i>Blood on the Clocktower</i></a>.</p>
                <p>I am developing the mod with the help of Benjamin Brook and Ellejon DeLeon, who are each creating the visual designs of the jokers. I am the sole programmer. On the left are some of the boss blinds added by the mod, outlined in red.</p>
